Hello,

My name is Scott Coleman. I live in and go to University in Edinburgh, Scotland, where I study Computer Science.

My work is developing software for mobile and web applications. I also have an I.T. consulting business where I help clients take advantage of the recent advances in cloud computing.

I also practise photography. I use traditional film and print in the darkroom. My photographs are based around my life in the United Kingdom but I take my camera wherever I go.
